Store hours for WooCommerce: take orders only while you're open. Holiday closures, a pause switch, and a clear closed message for shoppers.

== Description ==

Order Window lets your WooCommerce store take orders only while you are open. Set your opening hours, close for holidays, and pause orders in one click when the kitchen is busy. Shoppers see when you're open and when you open next, and the store refuses orders it shouldn't take. It works on the Checkout block, the classic checkout and the Store API.

It's made for bakeries, cafés, restaurants, florists, grocers and any shop that can only fulfil orders at certain times.

= Opening hours that fit real shops =

* **Weekly hours:** as many time ranges per day as you need, ranges past midnight (6 pm – 2 am), days closed all day, or open 24 hours.
* **Holiday closures:** close your store for a date or a range of dates (vacation mode), with a label such as "Christmas" and an optional yearly repeat.
* **Special hours:** different hours on one date, such as a short day before a holiday.
* **Preview:** the next 14 days exactly as shoppers will see them, and whether you're open now and why not.
* **Time zone:** uses the time zone from Settings → General, and warns you when a fixed UTC offset means your hours won't follow daylight saving changes.

= Pause orders in one click =

Pause ordering from the admin bar or the Ordering tab: for 30 minutes, 1 or 2 hours, the rest of today, until the next opening, until a date and time you choose, or until you resume. It ends on its own.

= What happens while you're closed =

Pick one:

* **Block checkout:** shoppers can browse and fill their cart, but can't place an order until you open.
* **Accept orders for the next opening:** orders still come in, marked with the time they're scheduled for. The scheduled time shows on the order screen, in the order e-mails, on the thank-you page and in My Account.
* **Catalogue mode:** add-to-cart buttons show "Closed" and are disabled while you're closed.

The rules are checked on the server, not only on the page. They hold on the Checkout block, the classic checkout, direct Store API requests, add-to-cart (AJAX, Store API and add-to-cart links), "Order again" and express payment buttons.

Orders your staff create are never blocked: orders made in the admin, through the WooCommerce REST API, by other plugins and by subscription renewals go through at any hour. A customer can always pay for an order they already placed.

= Tell shoppers when you're open =

* **A closed message** with tokens: `{next_open}` (when you open next) and `{closures_label}` (the holiday's label).
* **A notice bar** at the top of WooCommerce pages or every page, which shoppers can dismiss.
* **Cart and checkout notices** explaining why they can't order now, or when their order is scheduled for.
* **"Store status" and "Opening hours" blocks**, and the shortcodes `[orderwindow_status]` and `[orderwindow_hours]`.

What shoppers see stays correct behind page caches, because the status is fetched after the page loads.

= Safe to try =

Enforcement is off when you first install the plugin. Set your hours, check the preview, then turn on "Enforce opening hours" on the Ordering tab when you're ready.

Shop managers can use Order Window, not only administrators.

== Contribute ==
Order Window is an open-source project. You can view the full sources (unminified JS) and contribute to the project on GitHub: [Click here](https://github.com/nsgawli/wp-orderwindow)

== External Services ==
This plugin does not connect to any external services. It sends no data off your site; the storefront status badge only calls your own site's REST API (`/wp-json/orderwindow/v1/status`).

== Installation ==

1. Make sure WooCommerce is installed and active.
2. In Plugins → Add New, search for "Order Window", then install and activate it. Or upload the zip in Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin.
3. Open Order Window in the admin menu. On the Store hours tab, set your weekly hours, closures and special hours.
4. Check the Preview under Store hours.
5. On the Ordering tab, choose what happens while you're closed, edit the closed message if you like, and turn on "Enforce opening hours".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does my store still take orders after I activated the plugin? =

Enforcement is off after install, so you can set your hours first. Turn on "Enforce opening hours" on the Ordering tab. Pausing works even while enforcement is off.

= Will it block orders my staff create? =

No. Order Window only checks orders shoppers place on your site. Orders created in the admin, through the WooCommerce REST API (for example a POS or phone-order app), by other plugins, and subscription renewals are never blocked.

= Can a customer pay for an order while the store is closed? =

Yes. Paying an order that already exists (the "Pay for order" page) is allowed at any time. Developers can change this with the `orderwindow_allow_order_pay_while_closed` filter.

= Does it work with the Checkout block and the classic checkout? =

Yes, both, and with direct Store API requests. The rules are checked on the server when the order is placed.

= Does it work with page caching? =

Yes. Cart and checkout pages are never cached, and every order is checked on the server. On cached pages, the notice bar, status block and catalogue buttons ask the store for the current status after the page loads, from a REST route that is never cached. We tested with WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP Fastest Cache and LiteSpeed Cache.

= Do express payment buttons (Apple Pay, Google Pay) get around the opening hours? =

No. The buttons stay visible, but the store refuses the order when it reaches checkout, with your closed message, and no order is created. We checked the requests the express buttons of WooCommerce Stripe Gateway and WooPayments send, on a test store. A live wallet payment hasn't been tested yet, so please verify it on your own store.

= Which time zone does it use? =

The one in Settings → General. Choose a city (for example "Europe/London") rather than a fixed UTC offset: with an offset, your hours stay on the same UTC time all year and won't follow daylight saving changes. Order Window shows a warning when your site uses an offset.

= Can shop managers use it? =

Yes. Anyone who can manage WooCommerce can change the hours, the ordering settings and pause ordering. Only administrators can turn on "Remove Data on Uninstall". Developers can change the capability with the `orderwindow_manage_capability` filter.

= What happens to my settings when I uninstall? =

They are kept, unless an administrator turned on "Remove Data on Uninstall" on Order Window's General Settings tab. On a multisite network, each site keeps or removes its own data according to its own setting.

= Do I need Order Window Pro? =

No. Order Window works fully on its own. Pro is an optional add-on for delivery and pickup slots.
