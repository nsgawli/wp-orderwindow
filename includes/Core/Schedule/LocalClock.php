 * Converts between UTC timestamps and local wall-clock time in one time zone,
 * with the engine's daylight-saving rules (09 §16.3):
 * - a wall time that doesn't exist (spring forward) resolves to the
 *   transition instant, the first valid instant after the gap (02:30 → 03:00
 *   in `America/New_York`; PHP's own `DateTime` gives 03:30);
 * - an ambiguous wall time (fall back) resolves to its first occurrence.
 *
 * Offsets come from `DateTimeZone::getTransitions()`, loaded once for a span
 * of years and searched in memory. Offset zones (`+05:30`) have no transitions
 * and use their fixed offset. Never reads the server's time zone.
 *
 * PHP before 8.1 has no transitions after 2037 (its zone data stops there,
 * `getOffset()` included), so on PHP 7.4 dates past 2037 have no DST here
 * either: the clock always agrees with PHP's own `DateTime` (OW-050).
